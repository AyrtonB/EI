# Electric Insights

Electric Insights provides a site to "Take a closer look at the supply, demand, price and environmental impact of Britainâ€™s electricity", it also exposes an API which this repository wraps with a Python client. The raw data made available from the Electric Insights site is collated within a Frictionless Data Package, with automated scripts to ensure it remains up-to-date. A number of exploratory notebooks are also included showing some of the analysis this data can be used for.
